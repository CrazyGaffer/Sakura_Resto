        text: "Phenomenal sushi; fresh clean and well balanced rolls. Soy sauce and wasabi were great as well which seems hard to find in the Nordic and Baltic countries. Good location, and servers were nice and friendly. Went early for lunch. It was packed by 12:15. Prices are very reasonable, especially for the quality and quantity of fish in each roll. 10/10 recommend going. Iâ€™ll be back for dinner!",
